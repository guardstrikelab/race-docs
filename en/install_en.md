Before installation, ensure that the following ports are not occupied. Run the following command to check the ports.
```shell
sudo netstat -anp
```

If the following port number does not appear, go to the next step. Otherwise, close the corresponding program or run the command to kill the corresponding process.
```shell
MYSQL_PORT="3306"
REDIS_PORT="6379"
NGINX_PORT="8080"
ETCD_CLIENT_PORT="2379"
ETCD_SERVER_PORT="2380"
